<h1 align="center">🎥 HomREC</h1>

###

<p align="left">HomRec is a screen recording program created with one simple goal: to help people with weak computers record video without lags and slowdowns. If you have an old laptop, office PC, or just not very powerful hardware, and you've tried recording games or desktop with other programs (like OBS or Bandicam) but everything lagged — HomRec is made for you!^^</p>

###

<h2 align="left">🤔 Why does HomRec work on weak PCs?</h2>

###

<p align="left">💡 It's simple: the program is written to use minimum CPU and RAM resources. It doesn't load the computer with unnecessary effects, doesn't require a powerful graphics card, and can adapt to your hardware</p>

<h2 align="left">🛡️ Antivirus complains? Don't worry!</h2>

<p align="left">Some antiviruses (especially Kaspersky and Avast) may complain about HomRec because the program is new and not yet well-known. It's not a virus! I've published the entire source code on GitHub, any programmer can check it. If your antivirus blocks the program — just add the HomRec folder to antivirus exceptions. Everything will work immediately</p>
